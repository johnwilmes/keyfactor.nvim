# keyfactor.nvim

This is a work-in-progress refactor of the Neovim user interface, combining the best bits of
Neovim, Kakoune, and Emacs.

- Multiselections
- Text-object navigation
- Unified edit mode
- Layer-based keybinding and other tools for expressing consistent key grammars
- Wringable actions, generalizing the Emacs kill ring
- Consistent and configurable prompts
