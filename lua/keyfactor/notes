BASIC
    - implement basic textobjects - word, line, block, char
        - get user input
    - display of selection and cursor
        - default highlighting
        - draw focus
    - scrolling
        - mainly, some methods to introduce cursor into window
    - single range insert mode
    - registers
    - yank
    - select next and all
    - keybinding

POST-BASIC
    - undo/redo
    - selection history
    - multiselection insert mode
    - transient layers: lua and spell
    - textobjects: search, treesitter, surround
    - jumps and tags

ADVANCED
    - insert mode enhancements: autocompletion, etc.
    - quickfix stuff?
    - more transient layers
    - git stuff?
    - undo/redo rewrite?

how is association between selection lineage and window group maintained?
     handle.range:write within selection:iter - is this actually a good solution? it's anyway
     kind of hacky for cross-size register actions

actions can do something on arbitrary selections
    - if this is useful functionality, expose it via separate api call that takes the selection
      rather than the window group
if an action does something to the selection for a window, that should get updated
    - these user-facing ations should take window as argument

e.g. delete action:
    - api call takes multirange (associated with a particular buffer)
    - user-facing action takes window, and operates on whatever buffer is loaded in that window
      along with current multirange associated with that window+buffer

window group/frame
    - collection of windows/panes (>=1) of which 1 is focus
        - every window/pane has:
            - a buffer
        - some windows/buffers support multirange/selection but probably some special windows don't
